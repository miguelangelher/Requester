# Requester

Requester is a tool that automatizes a http https denial of service attack. Taking as an input a previous request captured from Zed Attack Proxy, it will repeat it using paralell threads as many times as the user wants. This tool designed with the aim of supporting the security testing process and guarantee that anti-repeating controls have been considered where necessary.
